CHAPTER 11
An Act respecting the development of a national
strategy to assess, prevent and address environmen-
tal racism and to advance environmental justice
[Assented to 20th June, 2024]
Preamble
Whereas the Government of Canada recognizes the
need to advance environmental justice across
Canada and the importance of continuing to work to-
wards eliminating racism and racial discrimination in
all their forms and manifestations;
Whereas a disproportionate number of people who
live in environmentally hazardous areas are mem-
bers of an Indigenous, racialized or other marginal-
ized community;
Whereas the establishing of environmentally haz-
ardous sites, including landfills and polluting indus-
tries, in areas inhabited primarily by members of
those communities could be considered a form of
racial discrimination;
Whereas the Government of Canada recognizes that
it is important to meaningfully involve all Canadians
— and, in particular, marginalized communities — in
the development of environmental policy and that
racial discrimination in the development of environ-
mental 
policy 
would 
constitute 
environmental
racism;
Whereas the Government of Canada is committed to
assessing and preventing environmental racism and
to providing affected communities with the opportu-
nity to participate in, among other things, finding so-
lutions to address harm caused by environmental
racism;
And whereas the Government of Canada recognizes
that collaboration and a coordinated national strate-
gy are key to promoting effective change and achiev-
ing environmental justice;

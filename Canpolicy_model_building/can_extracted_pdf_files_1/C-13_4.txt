French;
Whereas the Government of Canada is committed to
protecting and promoting the French language, rec-
ognizing that French is in a minority situation in

Whereas the Government of Canada recognizes the
diversity of the provincial and territorial language
regimes that contribute to the advancement of the
equality of status and use of English and French in
Canadian society;
Whereas consumers in Quebec or a region with a
strong francophone presence should have the right
to communicate in French with and obtain available
services in French from federally regulated private
businesses that carry on business in Quebec or the
region;
And whereas employees of federally regulated pri-
vate businesses who work in Quebec or a region with
a strong francophone presence should have the right
to work in French;

er than French.

(c) the employee claims the possibility of expressing
themselves in French;

or made a complaint to the Commissioner;
(e) the business is seeking to deter the employee from
exercising such a right or making such a complaint;

ried out tasks for, a committee established under para-
graph 10(1)(c) or a subcommittee created by such a

formation to the Commissioner in relation to a com-
plaint made under section 18 or participated in an in-
vestigation conducted as a result of such a communi-

lished under paragraph 10(1)(c) or to dissuade the em-
ployee from doing so.
Acquired rights in Quebec
(2) A federally regulated private business that has work-
places in Quebec must not treat adversely an employee
who occupies or is assigned to a position in one of those
workplaces on or before the day on which this subsection
comes into force for the sole reason that the employee
does not have a sufficient knowledge of French.
Language other than French
(3) Requiring an employee to have a knowledge of a lan-
guage other than French does not constitute adverse
treatment for the purposes of subsection (1) if the feder-
ally regulated private business is able to demonstrate
that a knowledge of that language is objectively required
by reason of the nature of the work to be performed by
the employee and the business sets out the reasons that
justify the requirement in any advertisement to fill a po-
sition that requires such knowledge.
Language other than French — minimum conditions
(4) For the purposes of subsection (3), in order to
demonstrate that a knowledge of a language other than
French is objectively required by reason of the nature of
the work to be performed by the employee, a federally
regulated private business must, before requiring such
knowledge, at a minimum,
(a) assess the actual language needs associated with
the work to be performed;

(b) verify that the language knowledge already re-
quired of other employees is not sufficient for the per-
formance of that work; and
(c) restrict the number of positions involving work
whose performance requires knowledge of a language
other than French.
Interpretation
(5) Subsection (4) is not to be interpreted as imposing an
unreasonable reorganization of a federally regulated pri-
vate business’s affairs.
Prevention of adverse treatment
(6) A federally regulated private business that has work-
places in Quebec must take all reasonable measures to
prevent, in the work environment, the adverse treatment
of an employee referred to in subsection (1) for any of the
reasons referred to in that subsection or of an employee
referred to in subsection (2) for the reason referred to in
that subsection.

workplaces in Quebec is made aware of the adverse treat-
ment, in the work environment, of an employee referred
to in subsection (1) for any of the reasons referred to in
that subsection or of an employee referred to in subsec-
tion (2) for the reason referred to in that subsection, it
must take all reasonable measures to make the adverse
treatment cease.

CHAPTER 20
An Act to establish a national framework for the pre-
vention and treatment of cancers linked to firefight-
ing
[Assented to 22nd June, 2023]
Preamble
Whereas firefighters play a critical role in keeping
Canadians and their communities safe;
Whereas Canadians have a profound appreciation of
and respect for the dedicated firefighters who put
themselves in harm’s way to provide an essential
service;
Whereas firefighters face numerous occupational
hazards in performing their duties, including expo-
sure to toxic chemicals;
Whereas research has shown that exposure to some
of these chemicals may lead to the development of
various cancers;
Whereas awareness and education are crucial to
helping firefighters identify early signs of occupation-
al cancers so that they can seek testing and treat-
ment;
Whereas federal and provincial collaboration and in-
formation sharing can facilitate the prevention and
early detection of cancers linked to firefighting;
Whereas establishing national standards on occupa-
tional cancers linked to firefighting could help pro-
vide greater consistency across Canada;
And whereas the Government of Canada, through
the Memorial Grant Program for First Responders,
recognizes the service and sacrifice of first respon-
ders who have died as a result of their duties, includ-
ing firefighters who succumb to cancers brought
about by their employment, by providing a benefit to
the beneficiaries of those first responders;

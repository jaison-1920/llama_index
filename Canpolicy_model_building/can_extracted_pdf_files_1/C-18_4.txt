RECOMMENDATION
Her Excellency the Governor General recommends to the House
of Commons the appropriation of public revenue under the cir-
cumstances, in the manner and for the purposes set out in a
measure entitled “An Act respecting online communications
platforms that make news content available to persons in
Canada”.
SUMMARY
This enactment regulates digital news intermediaries to enhance
fairness in the Canadian digital news marketplace and contribute
to its sustainability. It establishes a framework through which
digital news intermediary operators and news businesses may
enter into agreements respecting news content that is made
available by digital news intermediaries. The framework takes in-
to account principles of freedom of expression and journalistic
independence.
The enactment, among other things,
(a) applies in respect of a digital news intermediary if, having
regard to specific factors, there is a significant bargaining
power imbalance between its operator and news businesses;
(b) authorizes the Governor in Council to make regulations
respecting those factors;
(c) specifies that the enactment does not apply in respect of
“broadcasting” by digital news intermediaries that are
“broadcasting undertakings” as those terms are defined in
the Broadcasting Act or in respect of telecommunications ser-
vice providers as defined in the Telecommunications Act;
(d) requires the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommu-
nications Commission (the “Commission”) to maintain a list
of digital news intermediaries in respect of which the enact-
ment applies;
(e) requires the Commission to exempt a digital news inter-
mediary from the application of the enactment if its operator
has entered into agreements with news businesses and the
Commission is of the opinion that the agreements satisfy cer-
tain criteria;
(f) authorizes the Governor in Council to make regulations
respecting how the Commission is to interpret those criteria
and setting out additional conditions with respect to the eligi-
bility of a digital news intermediary for an exemption;
(g) establishes a bargaining process in respect of matters re-
lated to the making available of certain news content by digi-
tal news intermediaries;
(h) establishes eligibility criteria and a designation process
for news businesses that wish to participate in the bargaining
process;

(i) requires the Commission to establish a code of conduct
respecting bargaining in relation to news content;
(j) prohibits digital news intermediary operators from acting,
in the course of making available certain news content, in
ways that discriminate unjustly, that give undue or unreason-
able preference or that subject certain news businesses to an
undue or unreasonable disadvantage;
(k) allows certain news businesses to make complaints to the
Commission in relation to that prohibition;
(l) authorizes the Commission to require the provision of in-
formation for the purpose of exercising its powers and per-
forming its duties and functions under the enactment;
(m) requires the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation to pro-
vide the Commission with an annual report if the Corporation
is a party to an agreement with an operator;
(n) establishes a framework respecting the provision of infor-
mation to the responsible Minister, the Chief Statistician of
Canada and the Commissioner of Competition, while permit-
ting an individual or entity to designate certain information
that they submit to the Commission as confidential;
(o) authorizes the Commission to impose, for contraventions
of the enactment, administrative monetary penalties on cer-
tain individuals and entities and conditions on the participa-
tion of news businesses in the bargaining process;
(p) establishes a mechanism for the recovery, from digital
news intermediary operators, of certain costs related to the
administration of the enactment; and
(q) requires the Commission to have an independent auditor
prepare a report annually in respect of the impact of the en-
actment on the Canadian digital news marketplace.
Finally, the enactment makes related amendments to other Acts.

to be the subject of mediation sessions or final offer arbi-
tration during the bargaining process if the operator in
question

in question for the use of that content in accordance
with a licence or agreement between the operator and
the business; or

Identification of news outlets
30 When initiating the bargaining process, an eligible
news business or group of eligible news businesses must

question of the news outlets that are to be the subjects of
the bargaining process.
Application to Commission
31 (1) If the operator is of the opinion that a news outlet
identified under section 30 by an eligible news business
or group of eligible news businesses should not be a sub-
ject of the bargaining process, it may apply to the Com-
mission for a determination of the issue.
Determination

cess if the Commission is of the opinion that the outlet is
operated exclusively for the purpose of producing news
content — including local, regional and national news
content — consisting primarily of original news content
that is
(a) produced primarily for the Canadian news market-
place;
(b) focused on matters of general interest and reports
of current events, including coverage of democratic in-
stitutions and processes;
(c) not focused on a particular topic such as industry-
specific news, sports, recreation, arts, lifestyle or en-
tertainment; and
(d) not intended to promote the interests, or report on
the activities, of an organization, an association or its
members.
Special case — Indigenous news outlet

is to be a subject of the bargaining process if it
(a) operates in Canada; and

general interest, including coverage of matters relating
to the rights of Indigenous peoples, including the right
of self-government.

Agreements
Agreement with group
32 (1) If a group of eligible news businesses enters into
an agreement with an operator as a result of bargaining
or mediation sessions under the bargaining process, the
group must file a copy of the agreement with the Com-
mission within 15 days after the day on which it is en-
tered into.

mission considers necessary, disclose to the panel any in-
formation, including confidential information, in the
Commission’s possession that, in the Commission’s opin-
ion, is necessary for a balanced and informed decision-
making process, on the condition that the Commission
ensures that the arbitration panel or each individual arbi-
trator that presides over the final offer arbitration does
not further disclose any confidential information other
than during the arbitration, including by imposing any
further terms that the Commission considers necessary.
Confidentiality

necessary measures to ensure that confidential informa-

(b) for a second or subsequent offence, to a fine of not
more than $10,000.
Decision of arbitration panel
37 The arbitration panel makes its decision by selecting
the final offer made by one of the parties.
Factors
38 An arbitration panel must take the following factors
into account in making its decision:
(a) the value added, monetary and otherwise, to the
news content in question by each party, as assessed in
terms of their investments, expenditures and other ac-
tions in relation to that content;
(b) the benefits, monetary and otherwise, that each
party receives from the content being made available
by the digital news intermediary in question; and
(c) the bargaining power imbalance between the news
business and the operator of the digital news interme-
diary in question.
Dismissal of offers
39 (1) An arbitration panel must dismiss any offer that,
in its opinion,
(a) allows a party to exercise undue influence over the
amount of compensation to be paid or received;
(b) is not in the public interest because the offer
would be highly likely to result in serious detriment to
the provision of news content to persons in Canada; or
(c) is inconsistent with the purposes of enhancing
fairness in the Canadian digital news marketplace and
contributing to its sustainability.
Effect of dismissal
(2) If the arbitration panel dismisses, in accordance with
subsection (1), the final offer made by one of the parties,
it must accept the final offer made by the other party.
Reasons and new offers
(3) If the arbitration panel dismisses, in accordance with
subsection (1), the final offer made by each of the parties,
it must provide written reasons to the parties and give
them an opportunity to make a new offer.

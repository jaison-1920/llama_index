CHAPTER 10
An Act to amend the Telecommunications Act (trans-
parent and accurate broadband services information)
[Assented to 20th June, 2024]
Preamble
Whereas transparency and accuracy of information
are important to allow Canadians to make informed
decisions when choosing a Canadian carrier for fixed
broadband services and to increase competition
within the telecommunications industry;
Now, therefore, His Majesty, by and with the advice
and consent of the Senate and House of Commons of
Canada, enacts as follows:
1993, c. 38
Telecommunications Act
1 The Telecommunications Act is amended by
adding the following after section 24.1:
Definition of fixed broadband service
24.2 (1) In this section, fixed broadband service
means any high-speed data transmission service provid-
ed to a fixed location using cable, fibre optics, wireless
access, satellite or any similar transmission system.
Information required
(2) A Canadian carrier that offers fixed broadband ser-
vices shall make the following information available to
the public, in the form and manner specified by the Com-
mission:
(a) service quality metrics during peak periods;
(b) typical download and upload speeds during peak
periods; and
2021-2022-2023-2024

(c) any other information required by the Commis-
sion that is in the public’s interest.
Public hearings
(3) For the purposes of subsection (2), the Commission
shall hold public hearings to determine the following:
(a) the service quality metrics that are to be measured
and the manner in which they will be measured, as
well as the methodology that is to be used to ensure
that those metrics are representative of the different
fixed broadband services packages offered in different
regions across Canada;
(b) the methodology that is to be used to determine
what constitutes typical download and upload speeds
for different fixed broadband services packages of-
fered in different regions across Canada;
(c) the periods that are to be considered peak periods;
(d) the types of Canadian carriers, if any, that should
be excluded, in whole or in part, from the application
of subsection (2);
(e) the types of transmission systems in respect of
which the information referred to in subsection (2) is
to be provided;
(f) the form and manner in which the information re-
ferred to in subsection (2) is to be provided to the pub-
lic to ensure that it is easily available, accessible and
simple to understand; and
(g) the measures that are to be taken, including in re-
spect of compliance monitoring and enforcement, to
ensure that the ﬁxed broadband services provided by
Canadian carriers reﬂect the information made avail-
able under subsection (2).

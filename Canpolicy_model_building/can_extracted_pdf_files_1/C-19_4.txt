Page 4 
Division 2 of Part 3 amends the excise duty exemption under the

wholly of agricultural or plant product grown in Canada.
Division 3 of Part 3 amends the Excise Act to eliminate excise
duty for beer containing no more than 0.5% alcohol by volume.
Part 4 enacts the Select Luxury Items Tax Act. That Act creates a
new taxation regime for domestic sales, and importations into

vides that the tax applies if the total price or value of the subject
select luxury item at the time of sale or importation exceeds the
relevant price threshold. It provides that the tax is to be calculat-
ed at the lesser of 10% of the total price of the item and 20% of
the total price of the item that exceeds the relevant price thresh-
old. To promote compliance with the new taxation regime, that

other texts to ensure proper implementation of the new tax and
to ensure a cohesive and efficient administration by the CRA.

ment during the period that that Taxation Agreement is, by its

tions Act.

poration Act by adding the President and Chief Executive Officer

rangements Act to authorize additional payments to the
provinces and territories.

amount that may be borrowed. It also amends the Financial Ad-
ministration Act to change certain reporting requirements in re-
lation to amounts borrowed under orders made under para-

Canada Revenue Agency may make or cause to be made
one or more copies of it and, in the case of an electronic
record, make or cause to be made a print-out of the elec-
tronic record, and any record purporting to be certified
by the Minister or an authorized person to be a copy of
the record, or to be a print-out of an electronic record,
made under this section is evidence of the nature and

Action after judgment
(5) Despite any other provision in this section, if a per-
son has served a notice of objection under this Act to an
assessment or has appealed to the Tax Court of Canada

ter to delay proceedings on the objection or appeal, as the
case may be, until judgment has been given in another
action before the Tax Court of Canada, the Federal Court
of Appeal or the Supreme Court of Canada in which the
issue is the same or substantially the same as that raised

take any of the actions described in subsection (1) for the
purpose of collecting the amount assessed, or a part of it,
determined in a manner consistent with the judgment of
the Court in the other action at any time after the Minis-
ter notifies the person in writing that the judgment has
been given by the Court in the other action.
Collection of large amounts
(6) Despite subsections (1) to (5), if, at any time, the total
of all amounts that a person has been assessed under this

ister may collect up to 50% of the total.

amount that the person has been assessed under this
Act in respect of which a portion remains unpaid;

days after the day on which the Minister required the
security; and
(b) must be in a form satisfactory to the Minister.
Failure to comply
(3) Despite subsections 139(1) to (5), the Minister may

that was required under subsection (1) if the security re-
quired under that subsection is not given to the Minister
as set out in this section.
Certificates
141 (1) Any amount payable by a person (in this section
referred to as the “debtor”) under this Act that has not
been paid as and when required under this Act may be
certified by the Minister as an amount payable by the
debtor.
Registration in court
(2) On production to the Federal Court, a certificate
made under subsection (1) in respect of a debtor must be
registered in the Court and when so registered has the
same effect, and all proceedings may be taken on the cer-
tificate, as if it were a judgment obtained in the Court
against the debtor for a debt in the amount certified plus
interest on the amount as provided under this Act to the
day of payment and, for the purposes of those proceed-
ings, the certificate is deemed to be a judgment of the
Court against the debtor for a debt due to Her Majesty in
right of Canada and enforceable as such.
Costs
(3) All reasonable costs and charges incurred or paid for
the registration in the Federal Court of a certificate made
under subsection (1) or in respect of any proceedings tak-
en to collect the amount certified are recoverable in like
manner as if they had been included in the amount certi-
fied in the certificate when it was registered.
Charge on property
(4) A document issued by the Federal Court evidencing a
registered certificate in respect of a debtor, a writ of that
Court issued pursuant to the certificate or any notifica-
tion of the document or writ (which document, writ or
notification is in this section referred to as a “memorial”)
may be filed, registered or otherwise recorded for the
purpose of creating a charge, lien or priority on, or a
binding interest in property in a province, or any interest
in, or for civil law any right in, such property, held by the
debtor, in the same manner as a document evidencing

person in the province in respect of a debt owing to
Her Majesty in right of the province
may be filed, registered or otherwise recorded in accor-
dance with the law of the province to create a charge, lien
or priority on, or a binding interest in, the property or in-
terest.
Creation of charge
(5) If a memorial has been filed, registered or otherwise
recorded under subsection (4),
(a) a charge, lien or priority is created on, or a binding
interest is created in, property in the province, or any
interest in, or for civil law any right in, such property,
held by the debtor, or
(b) such property, or interest or right in the property,
is otherwise bound,
in the same manner and to the same extent as if the
memorial were a document evidencing a judgment re-
ferred to in paragraph (4)(a) or an amount referred to in
paragraph (4)(b), and the charge, lien, priority or binding
interest created is subordinate to any charge, lien, priori-
ty or binding interest in respect of which all steps neces-
sary to make it effective against other creditors were tak-
en before the time the memorial was filed, registered or
otherwise recorded.
Proceedings in respect of memorial
(6) If a memorial is filed, registered or otherwise record-
ed in a province under subsection (4), proceedings may
be taken in the province in respect of the memorial, in-
cluding proceedings

tion or other recording of the memorial in favour of

intended to be filed, registered or otherwise recorded

ed by the memorial,
in the same manner and to the same extent as if the
memorial were a document evidencing a judgment re-
ferred to in paragraph (4)(a) or an amount referred to in
paragraph (4)(b), except that, if in any such proceeding
or as a condition precedent to any such proceeding, any
order, consent or ruling is required under the law of the
province to be made or given by the superior court of the
province or by a judge or official of the court, a like order,
consent or ruling may be made or given by the Federal
Court or by a judge or official of the Federal Court and,
when so made or given, has the same effect for the pur-
poses of the proceeding as if it were made or given by the
superior court of the province or by a judge or official of
the court.
Presentation of documents
(7) If
(a) a memorial is presented for filing, registration or
other recording under subsection (4), or a document
relating to the memorial is presented for filing, regis-
tration or other recording for the purpose of any pro-
ceeding described in subsection (6), to any official in
the land registry system, personal property or movable
property registry system, or other registry system, of a
province, or
(b) access is sought to any person, place or thing in a
province to make the filing, registration or other
recording,
the memorial or document must be accepted for filing,
registration or other recording or the access must be
granted, as the case may be, in the same manner and to
the same extent as if the memorial or document relating
to the memorial were a document evidencing a judgment
referred to in paragraph (4)(a) or an amount referred to
in paragraph (4)(b) for the purpose of a like proceeding,
except that, if the memorial or document is issued by the
Federal Court or signed or certified by a judge or official
of the Court, any affidavit, declaration or other evidence
required under the law of the province to be provided
with or to accompany the memorial or document in the
proceedings is deemed to have been provided with or to
have accompanied the memorial or document as so re-
quired.

Prohibition — sale, etc., without consent
(8) Despite any law of Canada or of a province, a sheriff
or other person must not, without the written consent of
the Minister, sell or otherwise dispose of any property or
publish any notice or otherwise advertise in respect of
any sale or other disposition of any property pursuant to
any process issued or charge, lien, priority or binding in-
terest created in any proceeding to collect an amount cer-
tified in a certificate made under subsection (1), interest
on the amount or costs. However, if that consent is sub-
sequently given, any property that would have been af-
fected by that process, charge, lien, priority or binding
interest if the Minister’s consent had been given at the
time that process was issued or the charge, lien, priority
or binding interest was created, as the case may be, is
bound, seized, attached, charged or otherwise affected as
it would be if that consent had been given at the time that
process was issued or the charge, lien, priority or binding
interest was created, as the case may be.
Completion of notices, etc.
(9) If information required to be set out by any sheriff or
other person in a minute, notice or document required to
be completed for any purpose cannot, because of subsec-
tion (8), be so set out without the written consent of the
Minister, the sheriff or other person must complete the
minute, notice or document to the extent possible with-
out that information and, when that consent of the Min-
ister is given, a further minute, notice or document set-
ting out all the information must be completed for the
same purpose, and the sheriff or other person, having
complied with this subsection, is deemed to have com-
plied with this Act, regulation or rule requiring the infor-
mation to be set out in the minute, notice or document.
Application for order
(10) A sheriff or other person that is unable, because of
subsection (8) or (9), to comply with any law or rule of
court is bound by any order made by a judge of the Fed-
eral Court, on an ex parte application by the Minister, for
the purpose of giving effect to the proceeding, charge,
lien, priority or binding interest.
Secured claims
(11) If a charge, lien, priority or binding interest created
under subsection (5) by filing, registering or otherwise
recording a memorial under subsection (4) is registered
in accordance with subsection 87(1) of the Bankruptcy
and Insolvency Act, it is deemed
(a) to be a claim that is secured by a security and that,
subject to subsection 87(2) of that Act, ranks as a se-
cured claim under that Act; and

(b) to also be a claim referred to in paragraph 86(2)(a)
of that Act.
Details in certificates and memorials
(12) Despite any law of Canada or of a province, in any
certificate in respect of a debtor, any memorial evidenc-
ing a certificate or any writ or document issued for the
purpose of collecting an amount certified, it is sufficient
for all purposes
(a) to set out, as the amount payable by the debtor,
the total of amounts payable by the debtor without
setting out the separate amounts making up that total;
and
(b) to refer to the rate of interest or penalty to be
charged on the separate amounts making up the
amount payable in general terms
(i) in the case of interest, as interest at the specified
rate under this Act applicable from time to time on
amounts payable to the Receiver General, without
indicating the specific rates of interest to be
charged on each of the separate amounts or to be
charged for any period, and
(ii) in the case of a penalty, the penalty calculated
under section 107 on amounts payable to the Re-
ceiver General.
Garnishment
142 (1) If the Minister has knowledge or suspects that a
person is, or will be within one year, liable to make a pay-
ment to another person that is liable to pay an amount
under this Act (in this section referred to as a “debtor”),
the Minister may, by notice in writing, require the person
to pay without delay, if the money is immediately
payable, and in any other case, as and when the money is
payable, the money otherwise payable to the debtor in
whole or in part to the Receiver General on account of
the debtor’s liability under this Act.
Garnishment of loans or advances
(2) Without limiting the generality of subsection (1), if
the Minister has knowledge or suspects that within 90
days
(a) a bank, credit union, trust company or other simi-
lar person (in this section referred to as an “institu-
tion”) will loan or advance money to, or make a pay-
ment on behalf of, or make a payment in respect of a

negotiable instrument issued by, a debtor that is in-
debted to the institution and that has granted security
in respect of the indebtedness, or
(b) a person, other than an institution, will loan or ad-
vance money to, or make a payment on behalf of, a
debtor that the Minister knows or suspects
(i) is employed by, or is engaged in providing ser-
vices or property to, that person or was or will be,
within 90 days, so employed or engaged, or
(ii) if that person is a corporation, is not dealing at
arm’s length with that person,
the Minister may, by notice in writing, require the insti-
tution or person, as the case may be, to pay in whole or in
part to the Receiver General on account of the debtor’s li-
ability under this Act the money that would otherwise be
so loaned, advanced or paid.
Effect of receipt
(3) A receipt issued by the Minister for money paid as re-
quired under this section is a good and sufficient dis-
charge of the original liability to the extent of the pay-
ment.
Effect of requirement
(4) If the Minister has, under this section, required a
person to pay to the Receiver General on account of the
liability under this Act of a debtor money otherwise
payable by the person to the debtor as interest, rent, re-
muneration, a dividend, an annuity or other periodic
payment, the requirement applies to all such payments to
be made by the person to the debtor until the liability un-
der this Act is satisfied and operates to require payments
to the Receiver General out of each such payment of any
amount that is stipulated by the Minister in a notice in
writing.
Failure to comply
(5) Every person that fails to comply with a requirement
under subsection (1) or (4) is liable to pay to Her Majesty
in right of Canada an amount equal to the amount that
the person was required under that subsection to pay to
the Receiver General.

and
(b) the amount that the institution or person was re-
quired under that subsection to pay to the Receiver
General.
Assessment

payable under this section by the person to the Receiver
General and, if the Minister sends a notice of assessment,
sections 72 and 92 to 106 apply with any modifications
that the circumstances require.
Time limit
(8) An assessment of an amount payable under this sec-
tion by a person to the Receiver General is not to be
made more than four years after the notice from the Min-
ister requiring the payment was received by the person.
Effect of payment as required
(9) If an amount that would otherwise have been ad-
vanced, loaned or paid to or on behalf of a debtor is paid
by a person to the Receiver General in accordance with a
notice from the Minister issued under this section or with
an assessment under subsection (7), the person is
deemed for all purposes to have advanced, loaned or paid
the amount to or on behalf of the debtor.
Recovery by deduction or set-off

Canada under this Act, the Minister may require the re-
tention by way of deduction or set-off of any amount that
the Minister may specify out of any amount that may be

in part, to the Receiver General on account of the
debtor’s liability under this Act.

to make the payment before the expiry of the 30 days, the
Minister may issue a certificate of the failure and direct
that the person’s things be seized.
Disposition
(2) Things that have been seized under subsection (1)
must be kept for 10 days at the expense and risk of the

er with all expenses within the 10 days, the Minister may
dispose of the things in a manner the Minister considers
appropriate in the circumstances.

tion of the amount owing and all expenses, must be paid
or returned to the owner of the things seized.

son, a judge is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds
to believe that the net tax for the period, determined
without reference to this section, would be a positive
amount and that the collection of all or any part of that
net tax would be jeopardized by a delay in its collection,
the judge must, on any terms that the judge considers
reasonable in the circumstances, authorize the Minister

all amounts, each of which is an amount that the per-
son would be entitled on that day to claim as a rebate
under Subdivision A of Division 4 of Part 1 or a nega-
tive amount that is required to be added in determin-
ing the net tax for the period;
(d) the net tax for the assessed period is deemed to

the Minister takes into account an amount that the
person would be entitled to claim as a rebate under
Subdivision A of Division 4 of Part 1 or a negative
amount that is required to be added in determining
the net tax for the period, the person is deemed to
have claimed the amount in a return filed under sec-

is the amount, if any, by which the fair market val-
ue of the property at that time exceeds the fair
market value at that time of the consideration giv-
en by the transferee for the transfer of the proper-
ty, and
B
is the amount, if any, by which the amount as-
sessed the transferee under paragraph 97.44(1)(b)
of the Customs Act, subsection 325(2) of the Ex-
cise Tax Act, subsection 160(2) of the Income Tax
Act, subsection 297(3) of the Excise Act, 2001 or

Pricing Act in respect of the property exceeds the
amount paid by the transferor in respect of the
amount so assessed, and
(e) the total of all amounts each of which is
(i) an amount that the transferor is liable to pay un-
der this Act for the reporting period of the transfer-
or that includes that time or any preceding report-
ing period of the transferor, or

able as of that time,

able in respect of part or all of the liability of the transfer-
or under this Act, the following rules apply:
(a) a payment by the transferee on account of the
transferee’s liability must, to the extent of the pay-
ment, discharge their liability; and
(b) a payment by the transferor on account of the
transferor’s liability only discharges the transferee’s

liability to the extent that the payment operates to re-
duce the transferor’s liability to an amount less than
the amount in respect of which the transferee was, by
subsection (2), made jointly and severally, or solidari-
ly, liable.
Transfers to spouse or common-law partner
(6) Despite subsection (2), if at any time an individual
transfers property to the individual’s spouse or common-
law partner under a decree, order or judgment of a com-
petent tribunal or under a written separation agreement
and, at that time, the individual and the individual’s
spouse or common-law partner were separated and living
apart as a result of the breakdown of their marriage or
common-law partnership as defined in subsection
248(1) of the Income Tax Act, for the purposes of para-
graph (2)(d), the fair market value at that time of the
property so transferred is deemed to be nil, but nothing
in this subsection limits the liability of the individual un-
der this Act.
Anti-avoidance rules
(7) For the purposes of this section, if a person transfers
property to another person as part of a transaction or se-
ries of transactions, the following rules apply:
(a) the transferor is deemed to not be dealing at arm’s
length with the transferee at the time of the transfer of
the property if
(i) the transferor and the transferee do not deal at
arm’s length at any time during the period begin-
ning immediately prior to the transaction or series
of transactions and ending immediately after the
transaction or series of transactions, and
(ii) it is reasonable to conclude that one of the pur-
poses of undertaking or arranging the transaction
or series of transactions is to avoid joint and sever-
al, or solidary, liability of the transferee and the
transferor under this section for an amount payable
under this Act;
(b) an amount that the transferor is liable to pay un-
der this Act (including, for greater certainty, an
amount that the transferor is liable to pay under this
section, regardless of whether the Minister has made
an assessment under subsection (4) in respect of that
amount) is deemed to have become payable in the re-
porting period of the transferor in which the property
was transferred, if it is reasonable to conclude that one
of the purposes of the transfer of the property is to
avoid the payment of a future charge debt by the
transferor or transferee; and

and
(ii) the amount determined by the formula

consideration is held by the transferor at that
time.

Reasonable grounds
(2) On receipt of the application, the Minister must de-
cide whether there are reasonable grounds to recom-

graph 4(1)(b) that are held by a person are entitled to the
same ranking that they would have been entitled to had
the order not been made, unless
(a) the person is a foreign national described in any of
paragraphs 4(2)(a) to (d); or
(b) the property is forfeited to Her Majesty in right of
Canada under section 4.2.
Costs
13.1 Any costs incurred by or on behalf of Her Majesty
in right of Canada in relation to the seizure or restraint of
property under an order made under paragraph 4(1)(b)
or the disposal of property forfeited under section 4.2 are
the liability of the owner of the property and constitute a
debt due to Her Majesty in right of Canada that may be
recovered in any court of competent jurisdiction.
Agreements
13.2 The Minister of Foreign Affairs may, with the ap-
proval of the Governor in Council, enter into an agree-
ment with a person respecting the use by the person, for

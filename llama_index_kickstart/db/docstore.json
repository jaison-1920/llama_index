I never graduated from college. Truth be told, this is the closest I've ever gotten to a college  \ngraduation. Today I want to tell you three stories from my life. Tha t's it. No big deal. Just three \nstories.  \n \n \nThe first story is about connecting the dots.  \n \nI dropped out of Reed College after the first 6 months, but then stayed around as a drop -in for  \nanoth er 18 months or so before I really quit. So why did I drop out?  \n \nIt started before I was born. My biological mother was a young, unwed college graduate student,  \nand she decided to put me up for adoption. She felt very strongly that I should be adopted by  \ncollege graduates, so everything was all set for me to be adopted at birth by a lawyer and his wife.  \nExcept that when I popped out they decided at the last minute that they really wanted a girl. So my  \nparents, who were on a waiting list, got a call in the mi ddle of the night asking: \"We have an  \nunexpected baby boy; do you want him?\" They said: \"Of course.\" My biological mother later found  \nout that my mother had never graduated from college and that my father had never graduated from  \nhigh school. She refused t o sign the final adoption papers. She only relented a few months later  \nwhen my parents promised that I would someday go to college.  \n \nAnd 17 years later I did go to college. But I naively chose a college that was almost as expensive  \nas Stanford, and all of m y working -class parents' savings were being spent on my college tuition.  \nAfter six months, I couldn't see the value in it. I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life and no  \nidea how college was going to help me figure it out. And here I was spending al l of the money my  \nparents had saved their entire life. So I decided to drop out and trust that it would all work out OK.  \nIt was pretty scary at the time, but looking back it was one of the best decisions I ever made. The  \nminute I dropped out I could stop t aking the required classes that didn't interest me, and begin  \ndropping in on the ones that looked interesting.  \n \nIt wasn't all romantic. I didn't have a dorm room, so I slept on the floor in friends' rooms, I returned  \ncoke bottles for the 5\u00a2 deposits to buy food with, and I would walk the 7 miles across town every  \nSunday night to get one good meal a week at the Hare Krishna temple. I loved it. And much of  \nwhat I stumbled into by following my curiosity and intuition turned out to be priceless later on. Let  \nme give you one example:  \n \nReed College at that time offered perhaps the best calligraphy instruction in the country.  \nThroughout the campus every poster, every label on every drawer, was beautifully hand  \ncalligraphed. Because I had dropped out and didn't have to take the normal classes, I decided to  \ntake a calligraphy class to learn how to do this. I learned about serif and san serif typefaces, about  \nvarying the amount of space between different letter com binations, about what makes great  \ntypography great. It was beautiful, historical, artistically subtle in a way that science can't capture,  \nand I found it fascinating.  \n \nNone of this had even a hope of any practical application in my life. But ten years later , when we  \nwere designing the first Macintosh computer, it all came back to me. And we designed it all into the  \nMac. It was the first computer with beautiful typography. If I had never dropped in on that single  \ncourse in college, the Mac would have never ha d multiple typefaces or proportionally spaced fonts.  \nAnd since Windows just copied the Mac, its likely that no personal computer would have them. If I  \nhad never dropped out, I would have never dropped in on this calligraphy class, and personal  \ncomputers mi ght not have the wonderful typography that they do. Of course it was impossible to  \nconnect the dots looking forward when I was in college. But it was very, very clear looking  \nbackwards ten years later.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4089, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5e1ce9cb-f7d9-44d5-8c3d-1e582ed1bebf": {"__data__": {"id_": "5e1ce9cb-f7d9-44d5-8c3d-1e582ed1bebf", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "SteveJobsSpeech.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\ML_projects\\llamaindex\\llama_index_kickstart\\data\\SteveJobsSpeech.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 255448, "creation_date": "2024-08-24", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-23"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "020270e7-55a8-4f35-88d0-8ec9a4715019", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "SteveJobsSpeech.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\ML_projects\\llamaindex\\llama_index_kickstart\\data\\SteveJobsSpeech.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 255448, "creation_date": "2024-08-24", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-23"}, "hash": "e8afaa1f42cc904de4ef413e7f0d472a835ec2b7b0b7c2918b0f191ede7d6f19", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Again, you can't connect the dots looking forward; you  can only connect them looking backwards.  \nSo you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in  \nsomething \u2014 your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever. This approach has never let me down, and it  \nhas made all the differ ence in my life.  \n \n \nMy second story is about love and loss.  \n \nI was lucky \u2014 I found what I loved to do early in life. Woz and I started Apple in my parents garage  \nwhen I was 20. We worked hard, and in 10 years Apple had grown from just the two of us in a  \ngarage  into a $2 billion company with over 4000 employees. We had just released our finest  \ncreation \u2014 the Macintosh \u2014 a year earlier, and I had just turned 30. And then I got fired. How can  \nyou get fired from a company you started? Well, as Apple grew we hired s omeone who I thought  \nwas very talented to run the company with me, and for the first year or so things went well. But  \nthen our visions of the future began to diverge and eventually we had a falling out. When we did,  \nour Board of Directors sided with him. S o at 30 I was out. And very publicly out. What had been the  \nfocus of my entire adult life was gone, and it was devastating.  \n \nI really didn't know what to do for a few months. I felt that I had let the previous generation of  \nentrepreneurs down - that I had d ropped the baton as it was being passed to me. I met with David  \nPackard and Bob Noyce and tried to apologize for screwing up so badly. I was a very public failure,  \nand I even thought about running away from the valley. But something slowly began to dawn on  \nme \u2014 I still loved what I did. The turn of events at Apple had not changed that one bit. I had been  \nrejected, but I was still in love. And so I decided to start over.  \nI didn't see it then, but it turned out that getting fired from Apple was the best thing  that could have  \never happened to me. The heaviness of being successful was replaced by the lightness of being a  \nbeginner again, less sure about everything. It freed me to enter one of the most creative periods of  \nmy life.  \n \nDuring the next five years, I sta rted a company named NeXT, another company named Pixar, and  \nfell in love with an amazing woman who would become my wife. Pixar went on to create the worlds  \nfirst computer animated feature film, Toy Story, and is now the most successful animation studio in  \nthe world. In a remarkable turn of events, Apple bought NeXT, I returned to Apple, and the  \ntechnology we developed at NeXT is at the heart of Apple's current renaissance. And Laurene and  \nI have a wonderful family together.  \n \nI'm pretty sure none of this woul d have happened if I hadn't been fired from Apple. It was awful  \ntasting medicine, but I guess the patient needed it. Sometimes life hits you in the head with a brick.  \nDon't lose faith. I'm convinced that the only thing that kept me going was that I loved w hat I did.  \nYou've got to find what you love. And that is as true for your work as it is for your lovers. Your work  \nis going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you  \nbelieve is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven't  \nfound it yet, keep looking. Don't settle. As with all matters of the heart, you'll know when you find it.  \nAnd, like any great relationship, it just gets better and better as the years roll on. So keep  looking  \nuntil you find it. Don't settle.  \n \n \nMy third story is about death.  \n \nWhen I was 17, I read a quote that went something like: \"If you live each day as if it was your last,  \nsomeday  you'll most certainly be right \". It made an impression on me, and since then, for the past  \n33 years, I have looked in the mirror every morning and asked myself: \"If today were the last day of  \nmy life, would I want to do what I am about to do today? \" And whenever the answer has been \"No\"  \nfor too many days in a row, I know I need to change something.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 2, "end_char_idx": 4037, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b9394562-5225-4022-9dff-cc82da03ac0f": {"__data__": {"id_": "b9394562-5225-4022-9dff-cc82da03ac0f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "SteveJobsSpeech.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\ML_projects\\llamaindex\\llama_index_kickstart\\data\\SteveJobsSpeech.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 255448, "creation_date": "2024-08-24", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-23"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "cd5afb6d-463c-4f3f-b659-f5a0aa70fe93", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "SteveJobsSpeech.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\ML_projects\\llamaindex\\llama_index_kickstart\\data\\SteveJobsSpeech.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 255448, "creation_date": "2024-08-24", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-23"}, "hash": "61899f008e7d56cc0a35b83b175f25303c5523be6003cd5f5fbbc425cd51aa81", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Remembering that I'll be dead soon is the most important tool I've ever encountered to help me  \nmake the big choices in life. Because almost everything \u2014 all external expectations, all pride, all  \nfear of embarrassment or failure - these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what  \nis truly important. Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap  \nof thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow  \nyour heart.  \n \nAbout a year ago I was diagnosed with cancer. I had a scan at 7:30 in the morning, and it clearly  \nshowed a tumor on my pancreas. I didn't even know what a pancr eas was. The doctors told me  \nthis was almost certainly a type of cancer that is incurable, and that I should expect to live no  \nlonger than three to six months. My doctor advised me to go home and get my affairs in order,  \nwhich is doctor's code for prepare to die. It means to try to tell your kids everything you thought  \nyou'd have the next 10 years to tell them in just a few months. It means to make sure everything is  \nbuttoned up so that it will be as easy as possible for your family. It means to say your go odbyes.  \nI lived with that diagnosis all day. Later that evening I had a biopsy, where they stuck an  \nendoscope down my throat, through my stomach and into my i ntestines, put a needle into my \npancreas and got a few cells from the tumor. I was sedated, but my  wife, who was there, told me  \nthat when they viewed the cells under a microscope the doctors s tarted crying because it turned \nout to be a very rare form of pancreatic cancer that is curable with surgery. I had the surgery and  \nI'm fine now.  \n \nThis was the clo sest I've been to facing death, and I hope its the closest I get for a few more  \ndecades. Having lived through it, I can now say this to you with a bit more certainty than when  \ndeath was a useful but purely intellectual concept:  \n \nNo one wants to die. Even pe ople who want to go to heaven don't want to die to get there. And yet  \ndeath is the destination we all share. No one has ever escaped it. And that is as it should be,  \nbecause Death is very likely the single best invention of Life. It is Lif e's change agent. It clears out \nthe old to make way for the new. Right now the new is you, but someday not too long from now,  \nyou will gradually become the old and be cleared away. So rry to be so dramatic, but it is quite true.  \nYour time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life. Don't be trapped by dogma \u2014 \nwhich is living with the results of other people's thinking. Don't let the noise of others' opinions  \ndrown out your  own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and  \nintuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is  \nsecondary.  \n \nWhen I was young, there was an amazing publication called The Whole Earth Cata log, which was  \none of the bibles of my generation. It was created by a fellow named Stewart Brand not far from  \nhere in Menlo Park, and he brought it to life with his poetic touch. This was in the late 1960's,  \nbefore personal computers and desktop publishin g, so it was all m ade with typewriters, scissors, \nand polaroid cameras. It was sort of like Google in paperback form, 35 years before Google came  \nalong: it was idealistic, and overflowing with neat tools and great notions.  \n \nStewart and his team put out seve ral issues of The Whole Earth Catalog, and then when it had run  \nits course, they put out a final issue. It was the mid -1970s, and I was your age. On the back cover \nof their final issue was a photograph of an early morning country road, the kind you might f ind \nyourself hitchhiking on if you were so adventurous. Beneath it were the words: \"Stay Hungry. Stay  \nFoolish.\" It was their farewell message as they signed off. Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish. And I have  \nalways wished that for myself. And now, as you graduate to begin anew, I wish that for you.  \nStay Hungry. Stay Foolish.  \n \nThank you all very much.  \n \nSJ \nView publication stats", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4132, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}}, "docstore/ref_doc_info": {"670761cc-3004-48f4-9e65-d55f94222c27": {"node_ids": ["69c9ab8a-ae54-4cad-b2f4-075f15840fa1"], "metadata": {"page_label": "1", "file_name": "SteveJobsSpeech.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\ML_projects\\llamaindex\\llama_index_kickstart\\data\\SteveJobsSpeech.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 255448, "creation_date": "2024-08-24", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-23"}}, "d92aea83-bee0-4db8-ad49-15188640c52c": {"node_ids": ["3babc896-d655-4c29-ba0a-6b886506a775"], "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "SteveJobsSpeech.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\ML_projects\\llamaindex\\llama_index_kickstart\\data\\SteveJobsSpeech.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 255448, "creation_date": "2024-08-24", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-23"}}, "020270e7-55a8-4f35-88d0-8ec9a4715019": {"node_ids": ["5e1ce9cb-f7d9-44d5-8c3d-1e582ed1bebf"], "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "SteveJobsSpeech.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\ML_projects\\llamaindex\\llama_index_kickstart\\data\\SteveJobsSpeech.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 255448, "creation_date": "2024-08-24", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-23"}}, "cd5afb6d-463c-4f3f-b659-f5a0aa70fe93": {"node_ids": ["b9394562-5225-4022-9dff-cc82da03ac0f"], "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "SteveJobsSpeech.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\ML_projects\\llamaindex\\llama_index_kickstart\\data\\SteveJobsSpeech.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 255448, "creation_date": "2024-08-24", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-23"}}}}
